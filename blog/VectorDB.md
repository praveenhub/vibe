# The Evolution and Integration of Vector Databases

## Key Insights on Embedding Models and Vector Search

The landscape of embedding models has dramatically democratized advanced ML capabilities, with thousands of models now available through platforms like Hugging Face. These technologies have moved from being exclusive to large tech companies to becoming accessible for everyday applications, enabling sophisticated retrieval for previously difficult-to-search content like videos, podcasts, and technical documents.

### The Vector Database Phenomenon

The emergence of embedding-based applications created a need for efficiently storing and searching high-dimensional vectors at scale, giving rise to specialized vector databases. Companies like Pinecone led this category in 2022-2023, with explosive growth following ChatGPT's launch. This growth was partly fueled by a misconception that embedding-based similarity search was the only viable method for retrieving context for Large Language Models (LLMs).

### Convergence of Technologies

What began as pure vector search engines has evolved significantly:

- Vector database providers now expand beyond similarity search to include filtering, faceting, and text search capabilities
- Elasticsearch repositioned as "a search engine with a fully integrated vector database" in 2024
- Established database vendors like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis integrated vector capabilities directly into their existing products

### Limitations of Simple Integration

Adding vector capabilities to existing databases isn't a complete solution:

- Many databases lack refined ranking mechanisms and relevance tuning that dedicated search engines have developed over decades
- High-quality information retrieval requires a deep toolbox of ranking strategies beyond simple vector similarity calculations
- Companies focused on search quality still need dedicated search engine functionality

## Conclusion

The industry overcomplicated the vector search landscape. "Vector databases" are effectively search engines with vector capabilities. The market is already correcting this categorization through convergenceâ€”vector search providers are adding traditional search features while established search engines incorporate vector search capabilities. Vector search represents another powerful tool in the retrieval engine toolbox rather than a category of its own.
